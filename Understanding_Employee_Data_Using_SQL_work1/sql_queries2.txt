                    FROM  dept 
                    WHERE  dept.deptno= 60) ;






Answer: (B)

Explanation: 
The meaning of “ALL” is the A.Age should be greater than all the values returned by the subquery. 
There is no entry with name “arun” in table B. So the subquery will return NULL. 
If a subquery returns NULL, then the condition becomes true for all rows of A. 
So all rows of table A are selected.
